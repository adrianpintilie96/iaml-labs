    "**Pro Tip** - You should always use a ['Dummy Model'](http://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/model_evaluation.html#dummy-estimators) (a ridiculously simple model) like this to compare with your 'real' models. It's very common for complex models to be outperformed by a simple model, such as predicting the most common class. When complex models are outperformed by 'Dummies', you should investigate why: often there was an issue with the code, the data, or the way the model works was misunderstood."

    "Now we want to explore the effect of the `k` parameter. To do this, train the classifier multiple times, each time setting the KNN option to a different value. Try `5`, `10`, `50`, `100`, `200`, `500`, `1000`, `1500` and `2000` and test the classifier on the test set. How does the k parameter effect the results? *Hint: Consider how well the classifier is generalising to previously unseen data, and how it compares to the dumb prediction accuracy.*"

    "With 1000 neighbours, the `N` class is almost always predicted correctly, but the other two classes are not. With fewer neightbors the `EI` class is predicted much better. The 5 neighbours solution is a more 'complex model' (why?) and the mean class accuracy seems to be worse. The choice of model will depend on your goals. If you don't care about predicting `IE` correctly, the `1000` neighbour model gives greater overall accuracy and is a simpler model - therefore one would prefer to err towards using it. However, your application may tolerate a drop in overall accuracy in return for better 'class accuracy' in a particular output - in this case, you may consider the more complex 5 neighbour model to get better `EI` accuracy.\n",

    "Read about the [logarithimic loss](http://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html) (or cross-entropy loss). It is often the error metric used when we are trying to optimise classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric takes as input the true labels and the estimated probability distributions (bernouli or multinomial). It makes sense to use this metric when we are interested not only in the predicted labels, but also in the confidence with which these labels are predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, think of the situation where you have a single test point and two classifiers. Both classifiers predict the label correctly, however classifier A predicts that the test point belongs to the class with probability 0.55, whereas classifier B predicts the correct class with probability 0.99. Classification accuracy would be the same for the two classifiers (why?) but the `log_loss` metric would indicate that classifier B should be favoured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Produce a scatter plot similar to the one in Question 2.10 but this time show `log_loss` on your y axis. Which value for `k` would you pick if `log_loss` was the error metric? Comment on why this might happen, and which metric would be a better evaluator of performance."

    "We would pick the 10-neighbours classifier as it has the lowest generalisation log loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is significantly different from the accuracy metric. One way to explain this is as follows. The 10-NN model, while it gets more instances wrong (lower accuracy), has a better judgement of its confidence in the prediction, whereas the 1000-NN model gets more instances right (higher accuracy), but its judgement is way off (for example, in instances where it gets it wrong, it may predict the wrong label with high confidence, impacting the log loss).\n",

    "You can, but you probably shouldn't! SVMs are not probabilistic classifiers (i.e. they only yield a classification decision and not a posterior probability distribution) - they are trained to minimise a distance metric. Other classifiers, such as logistic regression, **explicitly try to minimise the logarithmic loss**. It would make sense that these models would report a better log loss than an SVM, but the SVM could still be producing 'better' predictions e.g. rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless `sklearn` does provide a `predict_proba()` method which returns probability estimates on predictions by using cross-validation. You can also calibrate the predicted probabilities such that they perform better by the log_loss metric. See [here](http://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/calibration.html) for more information.\n",
